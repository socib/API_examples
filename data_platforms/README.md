# What are SOCIB data-platforms?

SOCIB data-platforms wrapp data-sources sharing the same platform which enables then a quick recovery of the latest or historical data comming from a specific platform (particularly useful in case of long-term platform-based monitoring). 

A certain SOCIB data-platform can be composed then by a single data-source (i.e only one deployment has been performed with it) or serveral (i.e more than one deloyment has been perfomed with it). 

Examples of long-term platform-based monitoring are the contonous monitoring performed SOCIB fixed-stations (HFRadar, Ocenographic buoys, Sea Level stations, Weather Stations etc) or other platforms recurringly deployed (ie SOCIB gliders involved in 'CANALES' missions).

SOCIB data-platforms constitute the first level of abstraction build over the data-sources, being the second one the so-called SOCIB data-products.


See here how to use it:

- What is a data-platform? ([Example 6](what_is_a_data_platform.ipynb))

- Searching for certain data-platform ([Example 7](searching_for_certain_data_platforms.ipynb)) by platform type.

- Requesting a data-plaform's historical files ([Example 8](requesting_a_data_platforms_historical_files.ipynb))

- Requesting a data-plaform's latest files ([Example 9](requesting_a_data_platforms_latest_files.ipynb))


# Who is addressed to?

Anyone interested in exploring SOCIB data archiving can use the API, that is, researchers for finding the data that better suit their study-cases or developers interested in integrating SOCIB data on its products.
