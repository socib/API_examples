Vertical motion associated with mesoscale and sub-mesoscale ocean features such as fronts, meanders, eddies and filaments plays a critical role in the exchanges of heat, fresh water and biogeochemical tracers between the surface and the ocean interior. Integrating our understanding of these processes to a climate scale, is one of the key challenges that faces Earth observation, limited by the high resolution of ocean data required to estimate the dynamic vertical transports and their correlation with horizontal heterogeneity. The forthcoming wide-swath satellite altimeter (SWOT) with a resolution one order of magnitude higher than previous instruments is the next big breakthrough in Earth observation. SWOT altimeter swaths will provide a perfect observational region around the Balearic Islands. Within PRE-SWOT, we anticipate the high resolution data that SWOT will provide, and lead the observations of vertical transports, associated with mesoscale and sub-mesoscale structures, that need to be collected. We propose a high-resolution multi-platform and multidisciplinary synoptic experiment. In situ systems, including gliders, drifters, CTD, ADCP, and water samples, will be coordinated with satellite data and modeling simulations to objectively determine physical and biochemical variability. The Spanish waters of the Western Mediterranean, have an unprecedented opportunity to provide an ideal ‘Pocket sized’ study region for quantification of the dynamic ocean interior exchange mechanisms, during the 60 days fast phase after launch in which the satellite will provide daily high resolution sea surface height measurements in selected areas of the global ocean.  This is an opportunistic proving ground for SWOT capability, such that this project will provide SWOT readiness and a national capability for observing the major global ocean climates.\n",
       "The members of this proposal have experience in the above-described activities. Both PIs of this project have participated in and/or lead several national and European funded projects as well as international initiatives where the problems addressed in this research have been identified, in journals such as “Nature”, as the next key elements to be solved in the coming years. More specifically, in the last 10 years their contributions provide the basis and approach for the present project: (1) studying mesoscale dynamics with satellite altimetry (2) estimating and analyzing vertical motion using Quasi-Geostrophic dynamics applied to in situ data, satellite data (3) exploring alternative mechanisms that can affect ocean ecosystems through combined multidisciplinary observations and modeling. Finally, the coordinator of this proposal is the only Spanish member of the present SWOT Science Team (SWOT-ST). PRE-SWOT brings expertise to the SWOT-ST, firstly in terms of experimental capacities for (sub) mesoscale multi-platform experiments and high resolution models, and secondly providing world class observational access to the region through Spanish infrastructure, including the fine tuning of regional in situ monitoring strategies, as essential preparatory activities needed before the launch of SWOT. The region described in this project is one of the Calibration/Validation and science sites, which will be targeted by in situ experiments during the fast sampling phase of SWOT. PRE-SWOT represents the unique opportunity for a leading Spanish contribution to the NASA-CNES SWOT mission.\n",

This study is anticipated to take place in the Southwest Mediterranean Sea, which harbors an unstable front between salty Mediterranean water and the relatively fresh Atlantic water entering through Gibraltar. This location was identified in pilot studies and provides an ocean laboratory with predictable frontal structures of the appropriate scale and energetics. We anticipate that the study will be in partnership with scientists from the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies - Spanish National Research Council and the University of the Balearic Islands (IMEDEA (CSIC-UIB)) and the Balearic Islands Coastal Observing and Forecasting System (SOCIB Research Infrastructure), in Mallorca, Spain, who conducted a cutting edge experiment âAlborExâ in the region in 2014.</td><td>socib-int-calypso-may2018</td><td>SOCIB INT CALYPSO May2018</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Multi-platform experiment that associates a sea turtle, drifters (3) and a glider. </td><td>socib-int-glidingturtles-jul2016</td><td>SOCIB INT GlidingTurtles Jul2016</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Multi-platform experiment that associates a sea turtle, drifters (3) and a glider. </td><td>socib-int-tortugasoceanografas-jun2017</td><td>SOCIB INT TortugasOceanografas Jun2017</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>GF-MR-0030_JERICO-TNA-Abacus-Sep2014_sdeep01</td><td>socib-tna-abacus-2014</td><td>SOCIB TNA Abacus 2014</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Deployment of Slocum G1 deep glider ideep01 in execution of its first ever test mission to prove hull resistance to maximum operative depth (975m) during January 2011.</td><td>socib-tst-depthtest-jan2011-ideep01</td><td>SOCIB TST DepthTest Jan2011 ideep01</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Deployment of Seaglider 1KA glider sdeep03 in execution of a test mission to prove hull resistance to maximum operative depth (975m) during July 2012.</td><td>socib-tst-depthtest-jul2012-sdeep03</td><td>SOCIB TST DepthTest Jul2012 sdeep03</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Deployment of Slocum G1 deep glider ideep00 in execution of a test mission to prove hull resistance to maximum operative depth (975m) during June 2012.</td><td>socib-tst-depthtest-jun2012-ideep00</td><td>SOCIB TST DepthTest Jun2012 ideep00</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Deployment of Slocum G1 deep glider ideep02 in execution of its first ever test mission to prove hull resistance to maximum operative depth (975m) during October 2011.</td><td>socib-tst-depthtest-oct2011-ideep02</td><td>SOCIB TST DepthTest Oct2011 ideep02</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Deployment of Slocum G2 deep glider sdeep00 in execution of a test mission to prove hull resistance to maximum operative depth (975m) and overall performance following a triangular path during Februay and March 2013, aborted after the 4th day due to a repetition of buoy pump errors and with corrossion detected on the CTD.</td><td>socib-tst-depthtesttriang-feb2012-sdeep00</td><td>SOCIB TST DepthTestTriang Feb2012 sdeep00</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Deployment of Slocum G1 deep glider ideep02 in execution of a test mission to prove hull resistance to maximum operative depth (975m) and overall performance following a triangular path during March 2012.</td><td>socib-tst-depthtesttriang-mar2012-ideep02</td><td>SOCIB TST DepthTestTriang Mar2012 ideep02</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Deployment of Slocum G1 coastal glider icoast00 in execution of a test mission to prove hull resistance to maximum operative depth (200m) and overall performance following a square-shaped path during May and June 2012.</td><td>socib-tst-testsquad-may2012-icoast00</td><td>SOCIB TST TestSquad May2012 icoast00</td></tr></table>"
